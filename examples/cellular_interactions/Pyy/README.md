# The implementation of Pyy model
This folder contains:
- `script.py`: the implementation file
- `policy.py`: the implementation of the policy model
- `policy.pt`: the policy model
- `monitor_script.py`: the visualization script. This file should be executed using `python3 monitor_script.py` in a folder that contains result files.

To execute the model after compilation,
- `python script.py`: execution without outputs
- `python script.py outout`: execution with outputs

To execute the visualization after outputs are available,
- `python monitor_script.py` within the folder that contains the outputs
